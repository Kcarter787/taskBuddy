# taskCat
I wrote taskCat because I want to keep track of exactly how I am
spending my time. The name comes from it being like a cat; it always wants to know what you're up to while you're working. 

# Whats it for?
Too often I feel like my day has slipped away from me despite my attempts to make a schedule for myself. I thought it might be useful if I created a program that tracks where my time ACTUALLY goes rather than where I WANTED it go. If not the solution to my problem, it will at least be a fun coding exercise :)

# Steps to use
- 1.) Run task_cat.py
- 2.) Input the task you are about to start
- 3.) Give a time estimate
- 4.) Press d when done with the task
- 5.) Add a comment (optional)
- Important metrics get logged to the task_log.csv file and you may add multiple entries per session.
