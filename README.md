# taskBuddy
I wrote task buddy because I want to keep track of exactly how I am
spending my time. Too often I feel like my day has slipped away from
me despite my attempts to make a schedule for myself. I thought it might 
be useful if I created a program that tracks where my time ACTUALLY goes rather
than where I WANTED it go. If not the solution to my problem, it will 
at least be a fun coding exercise :)
